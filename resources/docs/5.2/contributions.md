## Bug Reports

To encourage active collaboration, Laravel strongly encourages pull requests, not just bug reports. "Bug reports" may also be sent in the form of a pull request containing a failing test.

However, if you file a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix.

Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.

The Laravel source code is managed on Github, and there are repositories for each of the Laravel projects:

- [Laravel Framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework)
- [Laravel Application](https://github.com/laravel/laravel)
- [Laravel Documentation](https://github.com/laravel/docs)
- [Laravel Cashier](https://github.com/laravel/cashier)
- [Laravel Envoy](https://github.com/laravel/envoy)
- [Laravel Homestead](https://github.com/laravel/homestead)
- [Laravel Homestead Build Scripts](https://github.com/laravel/settler)
- [Laravel Website](https://github.com/laravel/laravel.com)
- [Laravel Art](https://github.com/laravel/art)

## Core Development Discussion

Discussion regarding bugs, new features, and implementation of existing features takes place in the `#internals` channel of the [LaraChat](http://larachat.co) Slack team. Taylor Otwell, the maintainer of Laravel, is typically present in the channel on weekdays from 8am-5pm (UTC-06:00 or America/Chicago), and sporadically present in the channel at other times.

<a name="which-branch"></a>
## Which Branch?

**All** bug fixes should be sent to the latest stable branch. Bug fixes should **never** be sent to the `master` branch unless they fix features that exist only in the upcoming release.

**Minor** features that are **fully backwards compatible** with the current Laravel release may be sent to the latest stable branch.

**Major** new features should always be sent to the `master` branch, which contains the upcoming Laravel release.

If you are unsure if your feature qualifies as a major or minor, please ask Taylor Otwell in the `#internals` channel of the [LaraChat](http://larachat.co) Slack team.

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Laravel, please send an e-mail to Taylor Otwell at <a href="mailto:taylor@laravel.com">taylor@laravel.com</a>. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Coding Style

Laravel follows the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) coding standard and the [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) autoloading standard.

### DocBlocks

`@param` tags should **not be aligned** and arguments should be separated by **2 spaces**.

Here's an example block:

    /**
     * Register a binding with the container.
     *
     * @param  string|array  $abstract
     * @param  \Closure|string|null  $concrete
     * @param  bool  $shared
     * @return void
     */
    public function bind($abstract, $concrete = null, $shared = false)
    {
        //
    }

### Code Style Fixer

You may use the [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) to fix your code style before committing.

To get started, [install the tool globally](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer#globally-manual) and check the code style by issuing the following terminal command from your project's root directory:

```sh
php-cs-fixer fix
```
